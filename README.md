## Heart Rate Prediction Project
## Overview
This project is designed to predict heart rates based on a pre-trained machine learning model. The training and preprocessing are done in the training.ipynb notebook, and the prediction interface is built in the run.ipynb notebook.<br>

## Files
* training.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for preprocessing the data and training the machine learning model.<br> It includes steps for feature scaling, model training, and saving the trained model weights to a file named model.json.<br>

* run.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook serves as the prediction interface. Users can input a file, and the notebook will utilize the saved model weights from model.json to predict the corresponding heart rates.

### Getting Started
* Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-rate-prediction.git
* cd heart-rate-prediction

Install the required dependencies:<br>
* pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the training.ipynb notebook to train the model and save the weights.

Once the training is complete, open and run the run.ipynb notebook to use the trained model for predicting heart rates.

### Usage
Execute the cells in the run.ipynb notebook.<br>

Input a file containing relevant data for heart rate prediction.<br>

The notebook will load the saved model weights and provide the predicted heart rates.<br>

### Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries specified in requirements.txt

### Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues or creating pull requests.
